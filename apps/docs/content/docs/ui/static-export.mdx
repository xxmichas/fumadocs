description: Enable static export with Fumadocs
---

## Overview

Fumadocs is fully compatible with Next.js static export, allowing you to export the app as a static HTML site without a Node.js server.

```js title="next.config.mjs"
/**
 * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
 */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
};
```

### Search

The search functionality of Fumadocs rely on route handlers, which is not supported by static export.

With the default search powered by Orama, you can build the search indexes statically following the [Orama Search](/docs/headless/search/orama#static-export) guide.
This allows the route handler to be statically cached into a single file, and search will be computed on browser instead.
